# Image_Processing_ComputerVision
Language: Python

# Overview
This project is an image processing application designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts of digital image processing, including the RGB color model, image manipulation techniques, and machine learning classification with KNN (K-nearest neighbors). The application is split into several parts, covering the basics of how images are stored and manipulated in code, image processing methods, simulation of monetized and premium app features, and the implementation of a KNN classifier to predict image labels.

Additionally, I voluntarily built a user interface (UI) (code provided) to interact with the application, making it user-friendly and accessible for users to process images and utilize the app's functionalities.

# NOTE
The UI file "test_project.py" is available for public view. Due to university policy, I cannot share the assignment-specific backend file, though it is available for viewing upon request.

# Installation:

# Prerequisites
Python 3
Pip (Python package installer)

# Required Packages
NumPy
Pillow (PIL)

# Using the UI
After launching the app, the UI will provide options to select and process images with the implemented features. You can choose to apply various filters, adjust brightness, rotate images, and more. Additionally, the premium features and the KNN classifier can be accessed through the GUI, offering an intuitive way to interact with the application's functionalities.

# Project Structure
The project is divided into several key parts:

Part 1: Implementation of the RGBImage class to handle basic image storage and manipulation.
Part 2: Introduction of image processing methods in the ImageProcessingTemplate class.
Part 3: Extension of Part 2 to simulate a monetized app with additional costs for processing methods.
Part 4: Further extension to simulate a premium app, adding new methods and a fixed upfront cost.
Part 5: Implementation of a KNN classifier to predict image labels based on provided datasets.
The UI component is developed as a separate Python file, providing an interface to interact with the core functionalities implemented in the project.
