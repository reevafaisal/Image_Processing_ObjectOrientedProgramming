# Image_Processing_ObjectOrientedProgramming

In this project, we made an image-processing app.

- Part 1 covers how images are stored in code.
- Part 2 introduces some image processing methods in a Processor Template.
- Part 3 uses inheritance to simulate a monetized app.
_ Part 4 uses inheritance to simulate a premium app with new methods.
- Part 5 implements a KNN classifier to predict the labels of images.
